Here you can find many commonly asked questions about the Cyberflix Media Center and it's operations. This page is both for Cyberflix Members and newcomers wishing to learn more. As always, be sure to visit the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy before using any of our services.</p> What is the Cyberflix Media Center? <p>The Cyberflix Media Center is private, member only streaming service and media solution aimed at offering high quality, free content for it's members. It was created by BobDaGecko after a lot of frustration with the common sketchy sites and the hassle of pirating content in general. It offers a very similar experience to other streaming services like Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, etc. and also offers a request system and lively community. Currently the Cyberflix Media Center offers nearly 1000 movies and over 100 full TV shows. It also has a growing library of Anime.</p> How do I get access? <p>Unfortunately due to limited resources and a nature of exclusivity, the Cyberflix Media Center employs the use of an application for new members. Along with this, the membership at Cyberflix is capped so applications don\u2019t open often. If you wish to check on the status of the application visit here.</p> Are there rules or guidelines to the Cyberflix Media Center? <p>Yes. There is a stringent level of respect and conduct expected of Cyberflix Members. These guidelines are laid out in three agreements. The Cyberflix Terms and Conditions, The Cyberflix Privacy Policy, and The Cyberflix Activity Agreement. The Cyberflix Terms and Conditions outline the expected conduct and usage among all users of Cyberflix Media services. These not only apply to Cyberflix Members but also to users. Meaning any user that is a part of the Cyberflix Community Discord, tests their speed with the server, or applies to become a Cyberflix Member all agree to abide by the Cyberflix Terms and Conditions. The Cyberflix Privacy Policy outlines the privacy and security agreement between the user (you) and Cyberflix Media (us). Many services offered by us collect usage and statistical data so we created the Privacy Policy to lay this out for you. Again any user using our services agrees to our Privacy Policy. Finally is the Cyberflix Activity Agreement. This is the only agreement of the three that does not automatically apply to any user of Cyberflix Media Services. The Activity Agreement only applies to Cyberflix Members and outlines the minimum usage requirements expected of Cyberflix Members in order to ensure active participation and usage of the Cyberflix Media Center. The Activity Agreement exists to create an active, healthy community within the Cyberflix Media Center.</p> Where does Cyberflix get it\u2019s content? <p>The Cyberflix Media Library sources its content from private, online sources. Some need to be paid, others are invite only. These sources have vast repositories of content and they offer very high quality. Much of the content found in the Cyberflix Media Library is higher quality than anything offered by many online streaming services such as Netflix.</p> Isn\u2019t where Cyberflix gets it\u2019s content piracy? <p>Yes it is. Cyberflix Media only pays for access to the private sources. Due to this, please keep in mind that you are streaming pirated content and if you feel this is unethical the please do not use our services. The Cyberflix Media Library sources its content from two standards, the well known and widely used Bittorrent network and the lesser known Usenet. Both have contributed similar amounts of the content in the Cyberflix Media Library.</p> Is Cyberflix secure and safe for me to use? <p>It is very safe and secure for users to use. Cyberflix Members connect via an encrypted connection to the Cyberflix Media Center host server. No outside user can peer into what anyone is doing besides Cyberflix Media Staff. Cyberflix Members have no connection to the root sources of any of the data and they simply stream the content. A lot of security layers and protection has gone into protecting and ensuring the safety of Cyberflix Members. Unlike collecting pirated content yourself or visiting one of the common streaming sites across the internet, there is no risk to Cyberflix Members in using our services.</p> Is there a way to view the Cyberflix Media Library without being a member? <p>Yes. The Cyberflix Media Library have all of it\u2019s content pushed to the watch history tracking service Trakt. Cyberflix Media does not use this account for keeping track of anything but the content hosted by the Cyberflix Media Center. You can view the Cyberflix Media Library here.</p> Does Cyberflix offer 4k content? <p>Unfortunatly, no. Streaming 4k content is very difficult for a variety of reasons. The first is storage. 4k files are very large, while Cyberflix does theoretically have unlimited storage, downloading and uploading, or just generally dealing with such large files can be a real pain. Next is due to many users/devices being unable to handle true 4k content. 4k content not only is the resolution but also the video and audio codec. Many devices don't support either meaning not only does the device not get the true 4k experience but the server has to change the literal file during streaming for the device to even play the file. This is known as transcoding and it is very hard on system rescources. It is best to support a widely supported, yet high quality format which is very high quality 1080p formats.</p> Is there a cost to the Cyberflix Media Center? <p>Not for Cyberflix Members. Cyberflix Members enjoy full, free access to all of the Cyberflix Media Library. Cyberflix Media handles the cost of the server however, it is not cheap to host the Center and it\u2019s operations. If you are interested, you can view the Cyberflix Media Center Budget here. As such, Cyberflix Media does accept donations.</p> How do I donate? <p>We don\u2019t often ask for donations despite the fact that we probably should. Server costs are high but we try to promote free and full access so we don\u2019t offer any real incentive to donate. Donations, however, do ensure the longevity of the Cyberflix Media Center and ensure the free access we strive to provide. If you wish to donate, you can visit here.</p> What is the QCA? <p>The QCA stands for the Cyberflix Office of Quality Control and Assurance and it principally manages a group of Cyberflix Members who work directly with Cyberflix Media Staff to test, and assist in the operations of the Cyberflix Media Center. The Cyberflix Media Center has many complicated parts to it and in order for Cyberflix Media Staff to ensure everything is working properly, it needs to be tested. This is what the Cyberflix Office of Quality Control and Assurance oversees. You can learn more about the QCA here.</p> Quick Access Links <p>Below is a list of links to different parts of the Cyberflix Media Center.

This means new unreleased features have access to them given to QCA Testers for testing. They have access to all libraries and have special permission in some applications. There are also private channels within the Discord for management purposes. Any features that are either behind a paywall or have limited access to will be test but access will be restricted upon release.</p> <p>Q: Are permission applied to user's accounts?</p> <p>A: No. QCA accounts are given out to QCA Testers and are tightly controlled by Cyberflix Media and Administration.
