# Welcome
Welcome to the documentation for the Cyberflix Bug Testing Taskforce. The Cyberflix Bug Testing Taskforce, or CBTTF for short, is a group of Cyberflix Members who work directly with BobDaGecko to test, and assist in the operations of Cyberflix. A Taskforce Member's primary job is to test the Media Center for bugs and other issues, and report them to BobDaGecko to be addressed. Their work is key to the success and operation of Cyberflix. They are very active and also assist in helping Members with questions and issues. They hold no administrative privileges, however, like any Cyberflix Member, they can report misconduct in accordance with the [Terms and Conditions](https://docs.cyberflix.io/about/terms-and-conditions). They are to be respected like any Cyberflix Member and should be shown gratitude for their work.

!!! question "CBTTF FAQ"

    **Q: What else does the CBTTF do?**

    A: You can see the full list of things they do under [Operations](https://docs.cyberflix.io/cbttf/operations/).

    **Q: Can I join?**

    A: In short, no, Taskforce Members are permanent and membership is capped at eight. However, in the rare chance that a member leaves, or is dismissed, an Application will be released in order to find a new member. You can view the application [here](https://forms.gle/EJRJnUKx4i5xd8H56). The password will be posted here in case of an opening.

    **Q: Do CBTTF Members have privileges regular members don't?**

    A: In some cases yes. They are meant to test things. This means new unreleased features have access to them given to Taskforce Members for testing. They have access to all libraries and have special permission in some applications. There are also private channels within the Discord for management purposes. Any features that are either behind a paywall or have limited access to will be test but access will be restricted upon release.

    **Q: Are permission applied to user's accounts?**

    A: No. CBTTF accounts are given out to Taskforce Members and are tightly controlled by Cyberflix Media and Administration. Any unauthorized action is monitored and can result in dismissal of a Taskforce Member. There is no personalization allowed and accounts are deleted and recreated on a regular basis as needed.
