# Cyberflix Quality Control and Assurance Operations Reference
!!! note "Disclaimer"

    Intended for Cyberflix Quality Control and Assurance Testers
    This is a reference manual, questions should asked via Discord Channels

## Purpose
Cyberflix Quality Control and Assurance is intended to assist and test in the operations of the Cyberflix Media Center. Each Member abides by the guidelines laid out by Administration (see [Guidelines](https://docs.cyberflix.io/cbttf/guidelines)). QCA Testers are on call to assist Administration in various functions and work with Administration while fulfilling assigned tasks. Cyberflix Quality Control and Assurance operates to ensure a safe, secure, and functional operation of the Cyberflix Media Center. They are volunteers in service to the Cyberflix Community and Administration.

## Leadership and Administration
Cyberflix Quality Control and Assurance is operated as a function of Cyberflix Media, thus it is headed by Administration and is at the behest of BobDaGecko. The various tasks fulfilled are assigned only by BobDaGecko. BobDaGecko and Administration have the authority to dismiss QCA Testers at anytime in accordance with the Guidelines of Cyberflix Quality Control and Assurance.

The Cyberflix Quality Control and Assurance Director is a non-administrative leadership role assigned to a senior member of Cyberflix Quality Control and Assurance. They work with BobDaGecko and Administration to see that tasks are completed and fulfilled to their full purpose. They have no disciplinary authority, however they can recommend dismissal for a QCA Tester.

Leadership has full authority over QCA Testers and deserve respect. Malfeasance and disrespect will be met with appropriate disciplinary action up to termination of a Member's Cyberflix Account.

## Testing Operations
QCA Testers take part in heavy testing. Upon approval of a QCA Tester's application, they are assigned a QCA account and badge. These accounts give full access to all Cyberflix libraries and the Ombi Request System. From there a QCA Tester should begin using the various services and testing various functions. Below is a list of testing operations available to QCA Testers including but not limited to:

### Jellyfin
 - Accessing Jellyfin via the different clients. QCA Testers should install and access Jellyfin through all Clients available to them. A list of available Jellyfin Clients can be found [here](https://jellyfin.org/clients/).
 - Exploring Jellyfin menus and libraries. QCA Testers should explore the Jellyfin Menus for bugs and inconsistences in branding and theme. They should keep an eye out for odd colors of elements, missing text, the Jellyfin logo, the Cyberflix logo (as requested to be reported). They should also look for bugs. These include, links or buttons taking the user to an unexpected result, broken links and buttons, missing menus, and unexpected results from use.
 - Watching content. QCA Testers should watch content in all the libraries. They should look out for poor quality and/or performance, subtitles absent, wrong, or not working, duplicates of content, missing episodes, and wrong title art.
 - Testing Syncplay. BobDaGecko and/or the Taskforce Director will create a party to test Syncplay. In these tests, QCA Testers will watch content with the intent of testing Syncplay. The Taskforce Director will report to BobDaGecko on the results of this session incase of BobDaGecko's absence.
 - Various other duties will be assigned by BobDaGecko as needed.

### Ombi

!!! note Note

    This software is still under heavy development. Not only will reports go to BobDaGecko but also to the Ombi development team if necessary. 

 - Exploring Ombi menus. QCA Testers should explore the Ombi Menus and keep an eye out for bugs. Members should keep an eye out for links or buttons taking the user to an unexpected result, broken links and buttons, missing menus, and unexpected results from use.
 - Ombi has little custom theming done but Members should spot for inconsistencies.
 - Testing requests. QCA Testers will work heavily with BobDaGecko in developing the request system. They must be available for the full time a request takes to be fulfilled and will verify the process on their end as the process progresses.

### Discord

 - Notifying BobDaGecko to unauthorized access to restricted channels. QCA Testers must keep an eye out for channels that they have access to that should be restricted. Such channels must be reported immediately.
 - Using channels. QCA Testers must use channels for their purpose. They are to promote usage of the Discord and promote and attract to usage from Cyberflix Members.
 - Reporting misconduct. As any Cyberflix Member should do, QCA Testers must report misconduct immediately and without hesitation. Failure to do so will result in dismissal and termination of Membership if appropriate.

BobDaGecko may request testing for various other services. QCA Testers must be on call for this and failure for the all QCA Testers to turn down a request may result in dismissal of current members. Cyberflix Quality Control and Assurance is meant for testing and it is imperative it lives up to this purpose. For further guidelines to Cyberflix Quality Control and Assurance conduct, please see [Guidelines](https://docs.cyberflix.io/cbttf/guidelines).

## Support
The operations of the Cyberflix Media Center can be complicated for some Members and they may require help and support in using Cyberflix Services. Due to the nature of Cyberflix Quality Control and Assurance, QCA Testers are obligated to help regular Cyberflix Members in using the Cyberflix Media Center. QCA Testers are expected to have a good understanding of how many of the frontend operations work and know how to help members. There are support channels within the Discord server that allow Members to ask questions and request support. Cyberflix Media Staff is the primary form of help for Members but QCA Testers are also obligated to help. In the case of a QCA Tester not knowing an answer to a question or being unable to help further, the QCA Tester should forward the user to Cyberflix Media Staff by mentioning the role in Discord. QCA Testers can also contact Cyberflix Media Staff to resolve the issue. Please take note of the support guidelines [here](https://docs.cyberflix.io/cbttf/guidelines/).

## Meetings
Cyberflix Quality Control and Assurance meetings are all member meetings where both Cyberflix Media Staff and the QCA Director go over various things discussed earlier with each other, with QCA Testers. Ideally these shouldnâ€™t happen often but when they do, QCA Testers are required to attend (see [Guidelines](https://docs.cyberflix.io/cbttf/guidelines/#meetings)). Meetings are a good time to directly communicate with Cyberflix Media Staff and the QCA Director. Meetings usually start with Cyberflix Media Staff and the QCA Director going over items that have been discussed previously. Following this is when QCA Testers can ask questions and receive support. Any more complicated items can be discussed after the meeting. Meetings are conducted via Discord voice chat and by text. QCA Testers can choose to communicate either way but all QCA Testers must be connected to voice chat. They can be muted but not deafened.

## ID Badges
The Cyberflix Bug Testing QCA Testers are identifiable by their ID badge. These ID Badges are given to each QCA Tester and verify their membership. Each ID Badge is unique to each QCA Tester. There are five parts to each badge. 

The first is the QCA Tester's username, this is taken from their Discord account username. If they wish to be identified in a different way, they can contact Cyberflix Media Staff.

The second part is the ID, this is how QCA Testers are identified and it is also the username QCA Testers use when signing into Cyberflix services. The numbers are taken from their Discord account and cannot be changed. This way every member is unique to another member.

The third part is the Authorization ID (denoted as Auth ID) is the authentication level QCA Testers are at. Different QCA Testers may have different Authorization IDs but over time they may change over time. The Authentication ID is the only part of an ID Badge that actively changes. Below is a guide to understanding Authorization IDs.

??? tip "Auth ID Guide"

    Each letter in an Authorization ID means a separate access level. Below denotes what each letter means: 

    J: Jellyfin  
    Om: Ombi  
    Or: Organizr  
    W: Wiki/Documentation  
    D: Discord  

    Authorization IDs always follow the order as listed.

    Following this, an Authorization ID of JOmW would have access to Jellyfin, Ombi, and the Cyberflix Documentation. OrD would have access to Organizr and Discord. A full access QCA Tester would have JOmOrWD.

The fourth part of an ID Badge is the join date. This is pretty self explanatory but it denotes the date the user became a QCA Tester. This is important as it signifies seniority among members.

The final part is a hash code that is only used by Cyberflix Media Staff. This is found on the very bottom of the badge and it is the most unique part of each badge. Cyberflix Members and QCA Testers may ignore this.
