## General Conduct
The Cyberflix Office of Quality Control and Assurance and it's Testers are an extension of the Cyberflix Media operations. As such they reflect the guidelines laid out in the Cyberflix Terms and Conditions. Along with this, they are expected to help Cyberflix Media Center Members and also conduct testing operations as laid out in the Cyberflix Office of Quality Control and Assurance Operations. Since they will be dealing directly with Members and with Cyberflix Media Administration, there is a required level of conduct among QCA Testers. Below lays out, as an extension the Cyberflix Terms and Conditions, the conduct guidelines expected of QCA Testers.

1. When communicating with other Cyberflix Members, other QCA Testers, or Cyberflix Media Staff, QCA Testers must show a high level of respect. Since QCA Testers are an operational extension to Cyberflix Media, a higher level of scrutiny regarding [Prohibited Conduct](https://docs.cyberflix.io/about/terms-and-conditions/#4-prohibited-conduct) is established. Harassment, bullying, or general misconduct may have more severe punishments. Any form of harassment is strictly prohibited and any QCA Tester caught showing any form of harassment will be reprimanded and possibly have their membership to the Cyberflix Media Center terminated.
2. QCA Testers, including the QCA Director, are not Cyberflix Media Staff. Any QCA Tester caught impersonating Cyberflix Media Staff or disciplining any Cyberflix Member in any way may be subject to removal from their position within the Cyberflix Office of Quality Control and Assurance.
3. When offering support to Cyberflix Members, QCA Testers must show a very high level of respect, patience, and understanding. QCA Testers should never scrutinize another Memberâ€™s understanding, show any annoyance with the situation, or be generally rude and condescending in any way. Showing any of this may be labeled as harassment and the QCA Tester may be subject to more severe disciplinary action.

## Account Management
Cyberflix Office of Quality Control and Assurance Accounts are wholly owned by Cyberflix Media. They are lent out to QCA Testers. Due to the nature of the Cyberflix Office of Quality Control and Assurance, the accounts are given a lot of access to different services and are given access to manage their accounts. This, however, does not mean QCA Testers should tamper with their account. Account editing can only be done by Cyberflix Media Staff or under the direct supervision of Cyberflix Media Staff. Passwords must never be changed unless permission is given by Cyberflix Media Staff. The QCA Director does not hold the authority to authorize changes to QCA Accounts. Any tampering with QCA Accounts will result in either reversal of any changes or removal and reinstatement of the Account with disciplinary action taken against the offending user.

!!! note "Disclaimer"

    Cyberflix Bug Testing QCA Accounts may be removed, changed, or reset at any time. QCA Testers should use their regular Cyberflix Account in order to save progress and other account data.

## Activity
As the chief testing operation for the Cyberflix Media Center, a high level of activity and involvement among QCA Testers is expected. Outside of Testing Operations directed by Cyberflix Media Administration or the Cyberflix Office of Quality Control and Assurance, QCA Testers must maintain a Activity Standing of Good or higher per month as defined in the [Cyberflix Activity Agreement](https://docs.cyberflix.io/about/activity-agreement/#jellyfin-requirements). QCA Testers must also submit a request via the Ombi request system. Only one is required per month. Finally is general availability for Testing Operations, Syncplay Sessions, and QCA meetings in Discord. Below lays out what is expected.

 - Jellyfin Standing: Good or higher (1 Season/5 Movies / month)
 - Ombi: 1 Request / month

### Meetings
Meetings as described in [Operations](https://docs.cyberflix.io/cbttf/operations/#meetings), have required attendance. They are the most direct and important form of communication between the QCA Testers. If a member is not available for a scheduled meeting, they must contact either Cyberflix Media Staff or the QCA Director ahead of time. If a member fails to attend a meeting without notifying either Cyberflix Media Staff or the QCA Director, they risk being removed from their position within the Cyberflix Office of Quality Control and Assurance.
