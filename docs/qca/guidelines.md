## General Conduct
The Cyberflix Bug Testing Taskforce and it’s Members are an extension of the Cyberflix Media operations. As such they reflect the guidelines laid out in the Cyberflix Terms and Conditions. Along with this, they are expected to help Cyberflix Media Center Members and also conduct testing operations as laid out in the Cyberflix Bug Testing Taskforce Operations. Since they will be dealing directly with Members and with Cyberflix Media Administration, there is a required level of conduct among Taskforce Members. Below lays out, as an extension the Cyberflix Terms and Conditions, the conduct guidelines expected of Taskforce Members.

1. When communicating with other Cyberflix Members, other Cyberflix Bug Testing Taskforce Members, or Cyberflix Media Staff, Taskforce Members must show a high level of respect. Since Taskforce Members are an operational extension to Cyberflix Media, a higher level of scrutiny regarding [Prohibited Conduct](https://docs.cyberflix.io/about/terms-and-conditions/#4-prohibited-conduct) is established. Harassment, bullying, or general misconduct may have more severe punishments. Any form of harassment is strictly prohibited and any Taskforce Member caught showing any form of harassment will be reprimanded and possibly have their membership to the Cyberflix Media Center terminated.
2. Cyberflix Bug Testing Taskforce Members, including the Taskforce Director, are not Cyberflix Media Staff. Any Taskforce Member caught impersonating Cyberflix Media Staff or disciplining any Cyberflix Member in any way may be subject to removal from the Cyberflix Bug Testing Taskforce.
3. When offering support to Cyberflix Members, Taskforce Members must show a very high level of respect, patience, and understanding. Taskforce Members should never scrutinize another Member’s understanding, show any annoyance with the situation, or be generally rude and condescending in any way. Showing any of this may be labeled as harassment and the Taskforce Member may be subject to more severe disciplinary action.

## Account Management
Cyberflix Bug Testing Taskforce Accounts are wholly owned by Cyberflix Media. They are lent out to Taskforce Members. Due to the nature of the Taskforce, the accounts are given a lot of access to different services and are given access to manage their accounts. This, however, does not mean Taskforce Members should tamper with their account. Account editing can only be done by Cyberflix Media Staff or under the direct supervision of Cyberflix Media Staff. Passwords must never be changed unless permission is given by Cyberflix Media Staff. The Taskforce Director does not hold the authority to authorize changes to Taskforce Accounts. Any tampering with Taskforce Accounts will result in either reversal of any changes or removal and reinstatement of the Account with disciplinary action taken against the offending user.

!!! note "Disclaimer"

    Cyberflix Bug Testing Taskforce Accounts may be removed, changed, or reset at any time. Taskforce Members should use their regular Cyberflix Account in order to save progress and other account data.

If a member fails to attend a meeting without notifying either Cyberflix Media Staff or the Taskforce Director, they risk being removed from the Taskforce.
