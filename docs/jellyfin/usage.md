# Using and Navigating Jellyfin
Jellyfin is a very user-friendly service. Those who use many popular streaming services will feel right at home. To get started you need to use one of the many [Jellyfin Clients](https://docs.cyberflix.io/jellyfin/clients/) (recommended) or access Jellyfin via [web browser](https://www.cyberflix.io/jellyfin/).

## Signing In
Jellyfin is not developed by Cyberflix Media and is used by many others. Due to this, by default, Jellyfin does not know what server to connect to. You will need to enter the server address for the Cyberflix Jellyfin server. Fortunatly this is very easy to remember. It is simply the web address for Jellyfin. When Jellyfin asks to enter your server please enter:

`https://www.cyberflix.io/jellyfin`

After you have entered the server, the next screen should prompt you to enter your username and password. Please enter your username and password that you chose when you created your account.

## The Home Screen
The home screen is the first screen you will see when logging into Jellyfin. While it varies from client to client, the layout is generally the same.
