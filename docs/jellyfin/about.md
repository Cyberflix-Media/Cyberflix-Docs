# What is Jellyfin?
Jellyfin is the frontend media system for the Cyberflix Media Center. It is what Cyberflix Members use to view and stream the Cyberflix Media libraries. Jellyfin was originally developed as a fork of Emby, a similar service which itself is a competitor to the very popular Plex Media System. It offers a similar experience to streaming services such as Netflix. This part of the documentation will explain how to use Jellyfin.
