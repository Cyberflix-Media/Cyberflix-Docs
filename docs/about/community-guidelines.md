# Cyberflix Community Guidelines
## Last Updated: November 11, 2021.
________________________________________
The Cyberflix Media Center was created to allow users to watch what they want and to bring users together to enjoy the content that is out there. A part of this goal is to grow a safe community for users to feel comfortable and happy to be a part of.

Our Community Guidelines were established to not only establish this community but to also ensure its continuity. They lay out what is expected of users across all of Cyberflix Media Services. It is our goal to ensure everyone has the best experience we can offer.

Most users of the Cyberflix Media Center believe in our goal of fostering a safe community for everyone. However, it is impeccable that users report any misconduct conducted by other users. We may take a number of steps including issuing a warning, removing the content, or terminating the user’s access to Cyberflix Media services in accordance with the Cyberflix Media Center Terms and Conditions.

As a user of Cyberflix Media services you agree to the following guidelines:

1. Do not engage in harassment, abuse, bullying, or general toxicity under any circumstances. Any user who is caught abusing another user in any way will be removed from the server in accordance with the Terms and Conditions.
2. Do not engage in or promote hate speech. It’s unacceptable to attack a person or a community based on attributes such as their race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, or disabilities.
3. You may not share content that glorifies or promotes suicide or self-harm, including any encouragement to others to cut themselves, or embrace eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia.
4. Excessive profanity or vulgar language is prohibited. Use of racial slurs, homophobia, sexism, and offensive names will be viewed as harassment and may be grounds for removal from the server.
5. Do not make threats of violence or threaten to harm others. This includes indirect threats, as well as sharing or threatening to share someone’s private personal information (also known as doxxing).
6. Do not evade user blocks or server bans. Do not send unwanted, repeated friend requests or messages, especially after they’ve made it clear they don’t want to talk to you anymore. Do not try to hide your identity in an attempt to contact someone who has blocked you, or otherwise circumvent the tools we have which enable users to protect themselves.
7. Bypassing kicks, bans, and termination will result in permanent banning of the user from all Cyberflix Media Center operations and their user will be reported.
8. Do not send others viruses or malware, attempt to phish others, or hack or DDoS them.
9. Content considered “Not Safe for Work” or NSFW should be posted in appropriate channels. NSFW content includes content that includes nudity, excessive gore, and other content some may deem offensive. If you don’t know if content should be posted do not post it or contact Cyberflix Media Staff.
10. Self promotion and solicitation is strictly prohibited unless given express permission by Cyberflix Media Staff.
11. Use of Cyberflix Media services for discussing, enacting, or engaging in external disputes and conflicts is strictly prohibited. Any private disputes should be resolved in personal DMs. Users with issues and disputes with Cyberflix Media should contact Cyberflix Media Staff.
12. Users cannot use external relationships with Cyberflix Media Staff for personal gain. Cyberflix Media Staff does not recognize users in any way outside of the Cyberflix Media Center.
13. Impersonating Cyberflix Media Staff is strictly prohibited.
14. You may not sell your account or distribute it without express permission from Cyberflix Media Staff.
15. Failure to report misconduct is strictly prohibited and may result in termination of your account.
