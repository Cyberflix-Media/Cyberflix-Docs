________________________________________
Welcome to the Activity Agreement for the Cyberflix Media Center. In order to endure an active and healthy community, the following agreement must be agreed to by all Members of the Cyberflix Media Center.

Failure to abide by this agreement will result in administrative action as described in the Terms and Conditions.

## Activity Defined
Activity is a metric used by the Cyberflix Media Center to measure the usage of Cyberflix services and community involvement on the part of Members. Metrics that contribute to Activity do not contain any information that can be used to compromise the security or privacy of Members. See our [Privacy Policy](https://docs.cyberflix.io/about/privacy-policy/).

Activity is measured by monitoring Member usage in the following services:

1. Jellyfin
2. Discord
3. Ombi

Other services can be used freely without threat of administrative action.

## Maintaining Activity
Activity must be maintained on the part of the Members.

Activity can be maintained by doing the following:

1. Consuming content on Jellyfin
2. Participating in Discord
3. Requesting new content on Ombi

The easiest way to maintain Activity is to participate in the Discord. It is impeccable we receive feedback, insight, and involvement from Members. Cyberflix offers it's services for free and without any input from Members the direction and health of our service may deteriorate. Participating in Discord requires involvement in polls, community events such as watch parties, and discussion in chat channels.

### Jellyfin Requirements
This table lists the requirements to maintain Activity via Jellyfin. It is based of content consumed per month.

|Great|2 Seasons|10 Movies|
|Good|1 Season|5 Movies|
|Ok|5 Episodes|2 Movies|

### Discord Requirements
The easiest way to maintain Activity is to participate in the Discord. It is impeccable we receive feedback, insight, and involvement from Members. Cyberflix offers it's services for free and without any input from Members the quality and health of our service may deteriorate. Participating in Discord requires involvement in polls, community events such as watch parties, and discussion in chat channels.

### Ombi Requirements
It is not expected that Members request content every month, however requesting new content will put your account in good standing. Growing the library is always something we strive for and we can use all the help we can get. Members can request anything they wish but it has to be approved by BobDaGecko, though it almost always is.

## Account Parking
If a Member knows they will be unable to meet the minimum requirements for Activity, they can request that their account be parked. This means their login is disabled but their Activity will not be monitored.

At this time requests for account parking can be sent to BobDaGecko via Discord or at support@cyberflix.io.

An account can be parked for up to six months and one year concurrently before their account is terminated.

## Failure to Comply
If a Member fails to maintain an active account their account will be suspended. It will remain suspended for one month. After that, the account will be terminated and all data deleted. If a user wishes to regain access, they can submit an appeal which can be found in the Discord server.
