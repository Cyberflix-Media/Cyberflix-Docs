## Applications
To ensure the stability and best performance for the Cyberflix Media Center, there is a limit to how many concurrent members there can be. The current max amount of members is 30. Due to this limited space, the Media Center employs an application system for new members to join.

Applications are strictly required for any and all members of the Media Center. They must be approved by BobDaGecko.

Applications must be completed in full and all questions must be answered thoughtfully. A poor submission will require resubmittal of a new application. If an application if failed to be submitted by the end of an application window, they're application will be rejected.

Application windows do not have a set schedule or have any specific length. They can be started and ended at anytime. Members may not refer prospective applicants to the application outside of an application window. Members also cannot ask BobDaGecko for an application to share or for appeals.

Upon acceptance of an application, an invite link will be sent to the email address defined in the application. This membership is only valid for the single user who submitted the application. See Memberships.

## Memberships
As defined, a member is any user who has completed an accepted application and created an account. Members recieve full access to the entirety of the media center. The Cyberflix Media Center holds an open access policy of free and unrestricted access the Cyberflix libraries.

Members recieve no heirarchical status as apart of the open access policy. Any donations to Cyberflix Media will not result in any benifits at this time due to this. BobDaGecko is the only admministrator and no member has any moderation permissions. 

### Access policy
Memberships are only granted to individual users who submitted an accepted application. Account sharing is strictly prohibited. Account access is activly logged and tracked to enforce this policy. This is to limit the load on the server and to balance the expierince for all users. Any member found to infringe on this policy will be referred for administrative action.

Screen sharing is permitted and mutiple users may use a member account to watch content as long as a singular screen is used.

Special Access Accounts can be requested on behalf of Members for the following reasons:
 - To test out Media Center functions
 - To give temporary access to a friend or family member
 - For another authorized reason

 Special Access Accounts have to be authorized by BobDaGecko. Special Access Accounts are not to be abused and abuse can result in admistrative action. Special Access Accounts can be created and destroyed for any reason at any time by the user or BobDaGecko.

## Failure to Comply
If an member applicant does not accept these terms and conditions they're application will be rejected immediately. See Applications. Failure to abide by these Terms and Conditions or any rules defined elsewhere in the Media Center may resulte in consuquences.

There are three stages to moderation on the Cyberflix Media Center. The three stages are warnings, suspensions, and account terminations. Each offense will result in the next stage after the second offense. A first offender will get an account suspension upon the third offense. The following lists the stages.

 1. Warnings   
      a. The first warning may happen to most members, not a huge deal. The account will be warned but no restrictions will be applied.  
      b. The second warning is situatational, if this is just a simple mistake a second warning will be treated the same as the first warning. These can also be voided depending on the situation. If this a repeat offense, the warning will be more severe and depending on the case, may result in account restrictions.  
      c. Further warnings only apply if warnings are given to attend to mistakes or very minor offenses. Sympathy can be applied to warnings and this is only decided by BobDaGecko. Repeat offenders will recieve no sympathy and warning will total.
 2. Suspensions  
      a. After the second warning, if necessary, a member will recieve a one week suspension. Their account will be disabled and their access all Media Center services will be suspended. Appeals are not allowed to be submitted during a one week suspension. Failure to abide by this policy will result in another warning on the offenders account.  
      b. Upon the conclusion of the first suspension, if again, after the second warning, an offence is commited, the offending account will recieve a suspension of one month. An appeal can be submitted.
 3. Terminations  
      a. After the second suspension, any further infraction will result in termination of the offending account. In this case, all account details and credidentials are deleted and all user history and data is removed. An appeal can be submitted after three months from the termination and the user must submit a new application. Accounts will not be remade upon the acceptance of an appeal.  
      b. In extreme cases, the final action taken will be an IP ban. In this case a new rule will be in the webserver to reject requests from the offender's IP. The offender will no longer be able to access the Media Center in any way. This is permanant and any attempt to appeal or remake an account will be rejected. At this point the user is permanatly banned from the Media Center.
