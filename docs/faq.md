# Cyberflix Frequently Asked Questions
Welcome to the Cyberflix FAQ. Here you can find many commonly asked questions about the Cyberflix Media Center and it's operations. This page is both for Cyberflix Members and newcomers wishing to learn more. As always, be sure to visit the [Terms and Conditions](https://docs.cyberflix.io/about/terms-and-conditions) and [Privacy Policy](https://docs.cyberflix.io/about/privacy-policy) before using any of our services.

??? question "What is the Cyberflix Media Center?"

    The Cyberflix Media Center is an online streaming service aimed at offering high quality, free content for it's members. It was created by BobDaGecko after a lot of frustration with the common sketchy sites and the hassle of pirating content in general. It offers a very similar experience to other streaming services like Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, etc. and also offers a request system and lively community. Currently the Cyberflix Media Center offers nearly 1000 movies and over 100 full TV shows. It also has a growing library of Anime.

??? question "How do I get access?"

    Unfortunately due to limited resources and a nature of exclusivity, the Cyberflix Media Center employs the use of an application for new members. Along with this, the membership at Cyberflix is capped so applications don’t open often. If you wish to check on the status of the application visit [here](https://www.cyberflix.io/pages/applications.html).

??? question "Are there rules or guidelines to the Cyberflix Media Center?"

    Yes. There is a stringent level of respect and conduct expected of Cyberflix Members. These guidelines are laid out in three agreements. [The Cyberflix Terms and Conditions](https://docs.cyberflix.io/about/terms-and-conditions/), [The Cyberflix Privacy Policy](https://docs.cyberflix.io/about/privacy-policy/), and [The Cyberflix Activity Agreement](https://docs.cyberflix.io/about/activity-agreement/). The Cyberflix Terms and Conditions outline the expected conduct and usage among all users of Cyberflix Media services. These not only apply to Cyberflix Members but also to users. Meaning any user that is a part of the Cyberflix Community Discord, tests their speed with the server, or applies to become a Cyberflix Member all agree to abide by the Cyberflix Terms and Conditions. The Cyberflix Privacy Policy outlines the privacy and security agreement between the user (you) and Cyberflix Media (us). Many services offered by us collect usage and statistical data so we created the Privacy Policy to lay this out for you. Again any user using our services agrees to our Privacy Policy. Finally is the Cyberflix Activity Agreement. This is the only agreement of the three that does not automatically apply to any user of Cyberflix Media Services. The Activity Agreement only applies to Cyberflix Members and outlines the minimum usage requirements expected of Cyberflix Members in order to ensure active participation and usage of the Cyberflix Media Center. The Activity Agreement exists to create an active, healthy community within the Cyberflix Media Center.

??? question "Where does Cyberflix get it’s content?"

    The Cyberflix Media Libraries source their content from private, online sources. Some need to be paid, others are invite only. These sources have vast repositories of content and they offer very high quality. Much of the content found in the Cyberflix Media Libraries is higher quality than anything offered by many online streaming services such as Netflix.

??? question "Isn’t where Cyberflix gets it’s content piracy?"

    Yes it is. All the content is free. The Cyberflix Media Libraries source it’s content from to standards, the well known and widely used Bittorrent network and the lesser known Usenet. Both have contributed similar amounts of the content in the Cyberflix Media Libraries.

??? question "Is this secure and safe for me to use then?"

    It is very safe and secure for users to use. Cyberflix Members connect via an encrypted connection to the Cyberflix Media Center host server. No outside user can peer into what anyone is doing besides Cyberflix Media Staff. Cyberflix Members have no connection to the root sources of any of the data and they simply stream the content. A lot of security layers and protection has gone into protecting and ensuring the safety of Cyberflix Members.

??? question "Is there a way to view the Cyberflix Media Libraries without being a member?"

    Yes. The Cyberflix Media Libraries have all of it’s content pushed to the watch history tracking service Trakt. Cyberflix Media does not use this account for keeping track of anything but the content hosted by the Cyberflix Media Center. You can view the Cyberflix Media Libraries [here](https://www.cyberflix.io/pages/trakt.html).

??? question "Does Cyberflix offer 4k content?"

    Unfortunatly, no. Streaming 4k content is very difficult for a variety of reasons. The first is storage. 4k files are very large, while Cyberflix does theoretically have unlimited storage, downloading and uploading, or just generally dealing with such large files can be a real pain. Next is due to many users/devices being unable to handle true 4k content. 4k content not only is the resolution but also the video and audio codec. Many devices don't support either meaning not only does the device not get the true 4k experience but the server has to change the literal file during streaming for the device to even play the file. This is known as transcoding and it is very hard on system rescources. It is best to support a widely supported, yet high quality format which is very high quality 1080p formats.

??? question "Is there a cost to the Cyberflix Media Center?"

    Not for Cyberflix Members. Cyberflix Members enjoy full, free access to all of the Cyberflix Media Library. Cyberflix Media handles the cost of the server however, it is not cheap to host the Center and it’s operations. If you are interested, you can view the Cyberflix Media Center Budget [here](https://www.cyberflix.io/pages/budget.html). As such, Cyberflix Media does accept donations.

??? question "How do I donate?"

    We don’t often ask for donations despite the fact that we probably should. Server costs are high but we try to promote free and full access so we don’t offer any real incentive to donate. Donations, however, do ensure the longevity of the Cyberflix Media Center and ensure the free access we strive to provide. If you wish to donate, you can visit [here](https://www.cyberflix.io/pages/donate.html).
