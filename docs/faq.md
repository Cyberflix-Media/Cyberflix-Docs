Welcome to the Cyberflix FAQ. Here you can find many commonly asked questions about the Cyberflix Media Center and it's operations. This page is both for Cyberflix Members and newcomers wishing to learn more.

??? question "What is the Cyberflix Media Center?"

    The Cyberflix Media Center is something that is known as a media center. Now a media center for most people is a way they manage their movie collection, whether digital or physical (Blu-ray/DVD). In this case, Cyberflix is completely online and is a collection of digital media. It is the personal collection of BobDaGecko, however since Cyberflix has other members, the collection grows nearly everyday. On top of this all the content is sourced from private online sources that most don’t have access to. This allows for the latest, highest quality content to always be available for Cyberflix Members. There are a lot of pieces to how Cyberflix functions and it is very complicated but we did the work so you don’t have to.

??? question "How do I get access?"

    Unfortunately due to limited resources and a nature of exclusivity, the Cyberflix Media Center employs the use of an application for new members. Along with this, the membership at Cyberflix is capped so applications don’t open often. If you wish to check on the status of the application visit [here](https://www.cyberflix.io/pages/applications.html).

??? question "Are there rules or guidelines to the Cyberflix Media Center?"

    Yes. There is a stringent level of respect and conduct expected of Cyberflix Members. These guidelines are laid out in three agreements. [The Cyberflix Terms and Conditions](), [The Cyberflix Privacy Policy](), and [The Cyberflix Activity Agreement](). The Cyberflix Terms and Conditions outline the expected conduct and usage among all users of Cyberflix Media services. These not only apply to Cyberflix Members but also to users. Meaning any user that is a part of the Cyberflix Community Discord, tests their speed with the server, or applies to become a Cyberflix Member all agree to abide by the Cyberflix Terms and Conditions. The Cyberflix Privacy Policy outlines the privacy and security agreement between the user (you) and Cyberflix Media (us). Many services offered by us collect usage and statistical data so we created the Privacy Policy to lay this out for you. Again any user using our services agrees to our Privacy Policy. Finally is the Cyberflix Activity Agreement. This is the only agreement of the three that does not automatically apply to any user of Cyberflix Media Services. The Activity Agreement only applies to Cyberflix Members and outlines the minimum usage requirements expected of Cyberflix Members in order to ensure active participation and usage of the Cyberflix Media Center. The Activity Agreement exists to create an active, healthy community within the Cyberflix Media Center.

??? question "Where does Cyberflix get it’s content?"

    The Cyberflix Media Libraries source their content from private, online sources. Some need to be paid, others are invite only. These sources have vast repositories of content and they offer very high quality. Much of the content found in the Cyberflix Media Libraries is higher quality than anything offered by many online streaming services such as Netflix.

??? question "Isn’t where Cyberflix gets it’s content piracy?"

    Yes it is. All the content is free. The Cyberflix Media Libraries source it’s content from to standards, the well known and widely used Bittorrent network and the lesser known Usenet. Both have contributed similar amounts of the content in the Cyberflix Media Libraries.

??? question "Is this secure and safe for me to use then?"

    It is very safe and secure for users to use. Cyberflix Members connect via an encrypted connection to the Cyberflix Media Center host server. No outside user can peer into what anyone is doing besides Cyberflix Media Staff. Cyberflix Members have no connection to the root sources of any of the data and they simply stream the content. A lot of security layers and protection has gone into protecting and ensuring the safety of Cyberflix Members.

??? question "Is there a way to view the Cyberflix Media Libraries without being a member?"

    Yes. The Cyberflix Media Libraries have all of it’s content pushed to the watch history tracking service Trakt. Cyberflix Media does not use this account for keeping track of anything but the content hosted by the Cyberflix Media Center. You can view the Cyberflix Media Libraries [here](https://www.cyberflix.io/pages/trakt.html).

??? question "Is there a cost to the Cyberflix Media Center?"

    Not for Cyberflix Members. Cyberflix Members enjoy full, free access to all of the Cyberflix Media Library. Cyberflix Media handles the cost of the server however, it is not cheap to host the Center and it’s operations. If you are interested, you can view the Cyberflix Media Center Budget [here](https://www.cyberflix.io/pages/budget.html). As such, Cyberflix Media does accept donations.

??? question "How do I donate?"

    We don’t often ask for donations despite the fact that we probably should. Server costs are high but we try to promote free and full access so we don’t offer any real incentive to donate. Donations, however, do ensure the longevity of the Cyberflix Media Center and ensure the free access we strive to provide. If you wish to donate, you can visit [here](https://www.cyberflix.io/pages/donate.html).
