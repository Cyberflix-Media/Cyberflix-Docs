# Cyberflix Bug Testing Taskforce Operations Reference
!!! note "Disclaimer"

    Intended for Cyberflix Bug Testing Taskforce Members
    This is a reference manual, questions should asked via Discord Channels

## Purpose
The Cyberflix Bug Testing Taskforce is intended to assist and test in the operations of the Cyberflix Media Center. Each Member abides by the guidelines laid out by Administration (see [Guidelines](https://docs.cyberflix.io/cbttf/guidelines)). Taskforce Members are on call to assist Administration in various functions and work with Administration while fulfilling assigned tasks. The Cyberflix Bug Testing Taskforce operates to ensure a safe, secure, and functional operation of the Cyberflix Media Center. They are volunteers in service to the Cyberflix Community and Administration.

## Leadership and Administration
The Cyberflix Bug Testing Taskforce is operated as a function of Cyberflix Media, thus it is headed by Administration and is at the behest of BobDaGecko. The various tasks fulfilled are assigned only by BobDaGecko. BobDaGecko and Administration have the authority to dismiss Taskforce Members at anytime in accordance with the Guidelines of the Cyberflix Bug Testing Taskforce.

The Cyberflix Bug Testing Taskforce Director is a non-administrative leadership role assigned to a senior member of the Taskforce. They work with BobDaGecko and Administration to see that tasks are completed and fulfilled to their full purpose. They have no disciplinary authority, however they can recommend dismissal for a Taskforce Member.

Leadership has full authority over Taskforce Members and deserve respect. Malfeasance and disrespect will be met with appropriate disciplinary action up to termination of a Member's Cyberflix Account.

## Testing Operations
Taskforce Members take part in heavy testing. Upon approval of a Taskforce Member's application, they are assigned a CBTTF account and badge. These accounts give full access to all Cyberflix libraries and the Ombi Request System. From there a Taskforce Member should begin using the various services and testing various functions. Below is a list of testing operations available to Taskforce Members including but not limited to:

### Jellyfin
 - Accessing Jellyfin via the different clients. Taskforce Members should install and access Jellyfin through all Clients available to them. A list of available Jellyfin Clients can be found [here](https://jellyfin.org/clients/).
 - Exploring Jellyfin menus and libraries. Taskforce Members should explore the Jellyfin Menus for bugs and inconsistences in branding and theme. They should keep an eye out for odd colors of elements, missing text, the Jellyfin logo, the Cyberflix logo (as requested to be reported). They should also look for bugs. These include, links or buttons taking the user to an unexpected result, broken links and buttons, missing menus, and unexpected results from use.
 - Watching content. Taskforce Members should watch content in all the libraries. They should look out for poor quality and/or performance, subtitles absent, wrong, or not working, duplicates of content, missing episodes, and wrong title art.
 - Testing Syncplay. BobDaGecko and/or the Taskforce Director will create a party to test Syncplay. In these tests, Taskforce Members will watch content with the intent of testing Syncplay. The Taskforce Director will report to BobDaGecko on the results of this session incase of BobDaGecko's absence.
 - Various other duties will be assigned by BobDaGecko as needed.

### Ombi

!!! note Note

    This software is still under heavy development. Not only will reports go to BobDaGecko but also to the Ombi development team if necessary. 

 - Exploring Ombi menus. Taskforce Members should explore the Ombi Menus and keep an eye out for bugs. Members should keep an eye out for links or buttons taking the user to an unexpected result, broken links and buttons, missing menus, and unexpected results from use.
 - Ombi has little custom theming done but Members should spot for inconsistencies.
 - Testing requests. Taskforce Members will work heavily with BobDaGecko in developing the request system. They must be available for the full time a request takes to be fulfilled and will verify the process on their end as the process progresses.

### Discord

 - Notifying BobDaGecko to unauthorized access to restricted channels. Taskforce Members must keep an eye out for channels that they have access to that should be restricted. Such channels must be reported immediately.
 - Using channels. Taskforce Members must use channels for their purpose. They are to promote usage of the Discord and promote and attract to usage from Cyberflix Members.
 - Reporting misconduct. As any Cyberflix Member should do, Taskforce Members must report misconduct immediately and without hesitation. Failure to do so will result in dismissal and termination of Membership if appropriate.

BobDaGecko may request testing for various other services. Taskforce Members must be on call for this and failure for the entire Taskforce to turn down a request may result in dismissal of current members. The Taskforce is meant for testing and it is imperative it lives up to this purpose. For further guidelines to Taskforce conduct, please see [Guidelines](https://docs.cyberflix.io/cbttf/guidelines).

## Support
The operations of the Cyberflix Media Center can be complicated for some Members and they may require help and support in using Cyberflix Services. Due to the nature of the Cyberflix Bug Testing Taskforce, Taskforce Members are obligated to help regular Cyberflix Members in using the Cyberflix Media Center. Taskforce members are expected to have a good understanding of how many of the frontend operations work and know how to help members. There are support channels within the Discord server that allow Members to ask questions and request support. Cyberflix Media Staff is the primary form of help for Members but Taskforce Members are also obligated to help. In the case of a Taskforce Member not knowing an answer to a question or being unable to help further, the Taskforce Member should forward the user to Cyberflix Media Staff by mentioning the role in Discord. Taskforce Members can also contact Cyberflix Media Staff to resolve the issue. Please take note of the support guidelines [here](https://docs.cyberflix.io/cbttf/guidelines/).

## Meetings
Cyberflix Bug Testing Taskforce meetings are all member meetings where both Cyberflix Media Staff and the Taskforce Director go over various things discussed earlier with each other, with Taskforce Members. Ideally these shouldnâ€™t happen often but when they do, Taskforce Members are required to attend (see [Guidelines](https://docs.cyberflix.io/cbttf/guidelines/)). Meetings are a good time to directly communicate with Cyberflix Media Staff and the Taskforce Director. Meetings usually start with Cyberflix Media Staff and the Taskforce Director going over items that have been discussed previously. Following this is when Taskforce Members can ask questions and receive support. Any more complicated items can be discussed after the meeting. Meetings are conducted via Discord voice chat and by text. Taskforce Members can choose to communicate either way but all Taskforce Members must be connected to voice chat. They can be muted but not deafened.

## ID Badges
The Cyberflix Bug Testing Taskforce members are identifiable by their ID badge. These ID Badges are given to each Taskforce Member and verify their membership. Each ID Badge is unique to each Taskforce Member. There are five parts to each badge. 

The first is the Taskforce Members username, this is taken from their Discord account username. If they wish to be identified in a different way, they can contact Cyberflix Media Staff.

The second part is the ID, this is how Taskforce Members are identified and it is also the username Taskforce Members use when signing into Cyberflix services. The numbers are taken from their Discord account and cannot be changed. This way every member is unique to another member.

The third part is the Authorization ID (denoted as Auth ID) is the authentication level Taskforce Members are at. Different Taskforce Members may have different Authorization IDs but over time they may change over time. The Authentication ID is the only part of an ID Badge that actively changes. Below is a guide to understanding Authorization IDs.

??? tip "Auth ID Guide"

    Each letter in an Authorization ID means a separate access level. Below denotes what each letter means: 

    J: Jellyfin  
    Om: Ombi  
    Or: Organizr  
    W: Wiki/Documentation  
    D: Discord  

    Authorization IDs always follow the order as listed.

    Following this an Authorization ID of JOmW would have access to Jellyfin, Ombi, and the Cyberflix Documentation. OrD would have access to Organizr and Discord. A full access Taskforce Member would have JOmOrWD.

The fourth part of an ID Badge is the join date. This is pretty self explanatory but it denotes the date the user became a Taskforce Member. This is important as it signifies seniority among members.

The final part is a hash code that is only used by Cyberflix Media Staff. This is found on the very bottom of the badge and it is the most unique part of each badge. Cyberflix Members and Taskforce Members may ignore this.
